Fractions can be written using \"/\", but no letters are permitted. Once you have decided on an answer, press the \"check\" button and navigate to the next question. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n  To answer the questions, you can use the calculator widget that appears at the bottom of the test, or the internet. You may also want to use paper and a pencil.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nDon't spend too long on any one question, and remember that <strong>all questions must be answered </strong> before the completion code becomes available. If you have to guess, that is OK.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  \nYour participation in this project helps us to improve online math education. Thanks!\n</p>\n\n",
